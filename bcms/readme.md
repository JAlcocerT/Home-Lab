### Technical Architecture:

BCMS is an API-first, decoupled system where content storage and management are separated from presentation. This enables developers to build flexible user interfaces independent of the backend system, ensuring content can be delivered via REST or GraphQL APIs to websites, mobile apps, or other digital platforms.[5]

- Supports fast development by decoupling front-end and back-end.
- Global CDN ensures fast content delivery worldwide.

It can be used self-hosted or in the cloud, with free starter projects and integrations to jumpstart usage quickly.[6]
