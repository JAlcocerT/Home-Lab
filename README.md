# Home-Lab

A collection of docker-compose for your HomeLab. 

Giving back to all SelfHosters and Tinkers.


```sh
#docker compose up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
make setup
```

Connected to [https://fossengineer.com/](https://fossengineer.com/) to keep the configurations updated.

Feel free to raise an issue if some of them stopped working or you want to bring new projects.
