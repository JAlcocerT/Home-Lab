# Home-Lab

A collection of 150+ docker-compose for your HomeLab. 

```sh
#find ~/Desktop/IT/Home-Lab -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 2 -type d | wc -l
```

Giving back to all SelfHosters and Tinkers.

Let's make that having a HomeLab is as easy as:

```sh
#docker compose up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
make setup
```

Connected to [https://fossengineer.com/](https://fossengineer.com/) to keep the configurations updated.

Feel free to raise an issue if some of them stopped working *or you want to bring new projects.*
